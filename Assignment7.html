Wiki Media: Deployed by Vagrant a Comparison of Virtual Machines vs Docker. 

Docker is a containzered software development tool kit. It packages everything you need in terms of dependencies to run an application. Containers are run on the host operating system utilizing a smaller set of resources over virtual machines typically. Virtual machines provide a full fledge operating system on top of a computer's hypervisor. This virtual machine provides the flexibility of a complete operating system. Functionality such as a desktop environment, virtualized hardware, and multiple operating systems can be run from one machine running different apps at the same time.  

I prefer the flexibility of docker over virtualized machines. Most applications or server software required in my day to day is cross platform and are not operating system restricted making containerized software more appealing. Virtual machines leave behind a huge footprint on computer resources. Virtualization affects application performance whereas containerization runs on the physical host hardware. Virtual machines have specific hardware requirements to get up and running where Docker is less dependent on physical hardware and more reliant on operating system configuration.
